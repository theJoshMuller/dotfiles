The Bible is the mind of Christ and is the inspired, only infallible, authoritative Word of God. (Psalm 119:105, 160), (2Tim. 1:13; 3:16-17), (2Pet. 1:20-21)

There is one God manifested in three personalities: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God is the creator and ruler of the universe. (Gen. 1:1; 1:26-27; 3:22), (Psalm 90:2), (Isa. 9:6), (Mat. 1:22-23; 28:19), (John 1:1-15), (2 Cor. 13:14), (1Pet. 1:2)

The reality of Satan and his present control over unregenerate man does exist. (John 10:10), (2 Cor. 4:4)

Christianity is based upon the following:

The deity of our Lord, Jesus Christ: (Heb. 4:14-15)

His sinless life: (Rom. 1:3-4)

His miracles: (1Tim. 6:14-15), (Acts 2:22)

His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood.

(Tit. 2:13), (Rom. 5:8-11), (Isa. 53:4-12)

His bodily resurrection: (1Pet. 1:3)

His ascension to the right hand of the Father. (Acts 2:34)

His personal return in power and glory as Lord of lords and King of kings: (Tit. 2:13)

The fall of man and his lost state makes necessary a rebirth through confession and belief in the Lord Jesus Christ. (Rom. 7:23)

The reconciliation of man to God is by the substitutionary death and shed blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. (Rom. 5:1), (1 Cor. 15:3-4), (Gal. 3:26), (Eph. 2:8-9)

The resurrection of believers unto everlasting life and blessing in heaven, and the resurrection of unbelievers unto everlasting punishment in the torments of hell. (John 5:28-29)

The present supernatural ministry of the Holy Spirit among believers on the earth since the day of Pentecost and continuing until our Lord’s return. The Holy Spirit brings conviction, salvation, sanctification, and empowering for the believers and for Christ’s church. (Acts 1:8-11), (1 Cor. 2:12; 3:16), (2 Cor. 3:17)

Baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer’s faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Savior, the believer’s death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in the newness of life in Christ Jesus. (Matt. 3:13- 17), (Luke 3:21-22), (John 3:23), (Acts 8:35-39; 16:30-33), (Rom. 6:3-5),(Col. 2:12)

The Lord’s Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby believers, through partaking of the bread and the fruit of the vine, memorializing the death of Jesus and anticipate His second coming.(Matt. 26:26-30; 28:19-20), (Mark 14:22-26), (Luke 3:21-22; 22:19-20),(John 3:23), (Acts 2:41-42; 8:35-39; 16:30-33; 20:7), (Rom. 6:3-5),(1 Cor. 10:16; 10:21; 11:23-29), (Col. 2:12)

The church is built by Jesus. The church is His body, and He is filling all things within His church. Jesus is the head of His church. The church is to announce the manifold wisdom of God and is to make disciples of all nations. (Matt. 16:18; 28:18-20), (Eph. 1:18-23; 2:19-22; Eph 3:8-12)

The ministry gifts of Ephesians 4:11 are seen as imperative in the building of the church. God has placed these gifts in His church for its growth and maturity. (1 Cor. 12:28), (Eph. 4:12-13)

Oversight by a plurality of elders is to be given to the church. These elders function as equals, with one elder to serve as the first among equals. (Acts 15), (Tit. 1:5), (1 Pet. 5:1-5), (1 Tim. 3:1-7)

The local church is to be autonomous; however, the local elders are to relate to extended eldership for oversight, encouragement, counsel, or correction. (Acts 15)
